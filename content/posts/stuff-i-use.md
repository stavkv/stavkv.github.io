So this is About Stuff/Resources I use.

#### System

I have 2 Laptops:
 - One is old like from 2014. Its a Lenovo IdeaPad G500 series laptop. My linux testing and Other things which I want to try. And You can say like Server stuff, storing Data are done on this laptop.
   I upgraded it with a 240gb SATA SSD AND it has 8GB Ram. But a Old Dual core processor which is not good for today's world. But still it works to do basic tasks.

 - My Main machine is HP one with Ryzen 5500 series processor and 8GB Ram this is DDR4. On which i have [Debian](https://debian.org) With the BSPWM. Setup of BSPWM I posted in the Blog Section. I tried Many Operating System but Debian suits me and full fill my needs. Also Debian I use is not Debian Stable. I use Rolling Debian, which is also called as Debian Sid or unstable.
 - I tried many Window Manager like i3, bspwm, dwm, etc. But BSPWM suits my needs and feel like Home. So, I Choose BSPWM.
 - For Bar I used [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) but then I tried [tint2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tint2#:~:text=tint2%20is%20a%20simple%2C%20unobtrusive,not%20come%20with%20a%20panel.) and I switched to it, No specific reason.
 - Browser I use is [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
 - GUI Editor [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) And  Because of its extension support is easy and just works [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - Text Editor [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is the best text editor, Atleast for me it is beautiful and after adding plugin and Little bit of customisation it becomes incredible.
 - [GTK](https://gtk.org/) An open source GUI framework developed by GNOME Foundation, which I use regularly for personal apps.
 - [Python Telegram Bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) A Python framework for developing Telegram bots, used for my bots.
 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) I use MySQL for DBMS but SQLite is also great.
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the static site generator which i used for making this site. You can check source code at my [GitHub](https://github.com/singh-vikal).
- Stuff I read is not fixed I just search for that particular topic, and then i read which suits and feels good.
- I use both GitHub and GitLab for different works. Like u can say that I use GitHub for Work and Gitlab for personal dotfiles and other stuff.
