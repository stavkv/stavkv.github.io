TikTok has changed the world views on videos drastically in the recent years. From full-length 30min videos to 30s short video, people want to entertain themselves with just an infinite scroll of videos. People getting addicted to short videos.

The massive success of TikTok just brought in more like it, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels and much more.

Due to the infinite scroll of media that is relevant to your liking, I often find myself losing track of time and spending hours mindlessly swiping through the videos. This takes a total hit on my productivity. The recommendation system is so good to keep you in the scroll with more and more fresh content if you keep scrolling for hours, even when you know you should be doing something else. Also If i used instgram for 1 hour then i feel like I am tired from walking 3-4 km. Which at last make me less productive, or my day go complete waste.

What might seem like an entertaining and relaxing thing could make you less productive and after that you will feel that you wasted the day completely, and you fell guilty.

Simple steps you can take to cut this down:

Uninstall Instagram app, the website works as equally good on mobile, and there are far less chances you will be hooking yourself to reels on it.

Uninstall/Disable YouTube app, there is plently of alternative frontends on mobile (eg: NewPipe/LibreTube) to hold your basic YT needs.

I had been on a loop of spending a lot of hours on short media, and these are some small steps that did help me cut it down.
